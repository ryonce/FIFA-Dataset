# FIFA-Dataset

## Business Problem:
  - Can we take FIFA data on players and use it to evaluate players on the field based on statistics and characteristics

  - Use the data to report back to Coaches and Owners

## Data Source
  - My data was from FIFA 22 game coming from 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset?select=Career+Mode+player+datasets+-+FIFA+15-22.xlsx'

  - This data has stats, info, and characteristics on all the players in the FIFA game 22


## Data Analysis

  Visual 1(Top 22)

  - You can see that the experienced players are the ones with the higher wages and 1 veteran. 

  - This makes sense as most players get their high contract near the end of their prime years heading into experienced years.

  - Young are mostly near the lower amount of wages except for a couple creeping near the middle

  Visual 2 (Age Overal)
  
  - This shows the top 22 players on FIFA are mostly unique body types.

  - Also get a view how age is just a number when it comes to the top players!

  - The two outliers are K. Benzema (Normal) and J. Kimmich (Lean).
