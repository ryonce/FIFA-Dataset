# FIFA-Dataset

## Business Problem:
  - Can we take FIFA data on players and use it to evaluate players on the field based on statistics and characteristics?

  - We want to use the data to report back to Coaches and Owners about players. 

## Data Source
  - My data was from FIFA 22 game coming from 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset?select=Career+Mode+player+datasets+-+FIFA+15-22.xlsx'

  - This data has stats, info, and characteristics on all the players in the FIFA game 22.


## Data Analysis

    - This shows the top 22 players on FIFA are mostly unique body types.

    - Also get a view how age is just a number when it comes to the top players!

    - You can see that the experienced players are the ones with the higher wages and 1 veteran. 

    - This makes sense as most players get their high contract near the end of their prime years heading into experienced years.
 
    - Young are mostly near the lower amount of wages except for a couple creeping near the middle.

## Model Used

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123753784/232581829-c7353c9c-24d6-48a7-a8d9-f6eadd6dfe6a.png)

  - This model was overall 89% percent accurate in predicting players into a certain category! As you see, some categories were higher but with a 89% outcome for all categories, we would be able to help many clubs with predicting how players Overall Rating would be!

## Summary

  - This model was very good but we could be even better with testing other models and tweaking to get an even higher outcome. I think a good stragety would for out coaches and club owners is to do individual starts on players to see where they could fit into the categories. 
  - Another part that I would like to do is the potential of a player. These statistics are right now info, so would love to do another model on where players could end up being! 
  - In the end, just like many sports, this data shows the top players are unique with their bodies and have a great feel for the game. Using the graph on salaries, this would be great to help pay players at the right time for the right amount!
